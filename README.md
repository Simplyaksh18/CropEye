üåø CropEye: Predictive GIS Dashboard for Precision Agriculture Recruiter Summary: A predictive GIS dashboard for precision agriculture. It monitors Land Health (NDVI), Pest Risk, and Weather using advanced geospatial analysis. The project validates a scalable, production-ready architecture by demonstrating real-time data ingestion and processing capabilities with open satellite and synthetic sensor data.

üöÄ Project Overview CropEye is a full-stack, data-driven Geographic Information System (GIS) platform built to empower farmers with the predictive intelligence needed to optimize land health, manage risks, and maximize yield. It serves as a comprehensive visual interface that transforms complex geospatial and environmental time-series data into actionable, map-based insights for precision farming decisions.

‚ú® Key Features

CropEye provides a centralized, interactive map interface with real-time analytics across several critical domains:
Land Health Monitoring (NDVI/EVI): Visualize current and historical Vegetative Index (NDVI/EVI) data derived from open-access satellite imagery (e.g., Copernicus Sentinel). This allows for rapid identification of crop stress, nutrient deficiencies, and irrigation inconsistencies across the acreage.
Predictive Pest & Disease Risk Mapping: Integrates external models and simulated data to calculate and display hyper-local risk indices for common pests and diseases, based on environmental factors like temperature and humidity.
Hyper-Local Weather Forecasting: Delivers high-resolution, short-term weather forecasts directly layered onto the farm map, enabling timely scheduling of resource-intensive activities like spraying or harvesting.
Field-Level Data Aggregation: Allows users to define specific field boundaries to generate aggregated statistics and historical charts for soil, health, and weather metrics.
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Strategy: Scalability & Real-Time Simulation

This project is architected to be production-ready and showcases critical skills in data ingestion, time-series analysis, and scalable dashboard design‚Äîall essential for enterprise GIS roles.
Recruiter Note: Real-time data input is successfully demonstrated using industry-standard simulation and open-access data sources, confirming the system's ability to seamlessly integrate physical hardware (drones, in-field sensors) when available.
